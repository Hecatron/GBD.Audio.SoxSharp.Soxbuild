# Gbd.Audio.SoxSharp.SoxBuild

## Overview

This repository is a series of scripts for building out libsox and other associated libraries as dynamic dll's.
It also uses swig to expose the functionality of libsox to a .Net environment
as part of a larger .Net code library front end

Note only the old build process will work to begin with
